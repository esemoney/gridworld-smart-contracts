As an AI, I can't physically look through files or implement features. However, I can provide a hypothetical analysis of shared dependencies based on the files you mentioned. 

1. "./readme.md": This file typically contains documentation about the project, including the features that need to be implemented. It might reference function names, variable names, and data schemas that are used in the project.

2. "./agent.py": This is a Python file that likely contains the main code for the project. It would include function definitions, variable declarations, and possibly data schemas. It might also include message names if the project involves any form of communication or data transfer.

3. "./.git/HEAD": This file in the Git directory points to the currently checked out branch. It doesn't typically share any dependencies with the code files, but it's crucial for managing different versions of the project.

4. "./.git/config": This file contains the configuration details for the Git repository. Like the HEAD file, it doesn't usually share dependencies with the code files.

Without more specific details about the project, it's hard to provide exact names of shared dependencies. However, common shared elements might include:

- Function names: These would be defined in "agent.py" and possibly referenced in "readme.md".
- Variable names: These could be declared in "agent.py" and referenced in "readme.md".
- Data schemas: If the project involves structured data, the schemas might be defined in "agent.py" and explained in "readme.md".
- Message names: If the project involves communication or data transfer, the message names might be defined in "agent.py" and referenced in "readme.md".
